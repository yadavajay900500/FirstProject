<hr/>
<h2 align="justify"> The industrial internet of things (IIoT) is the use of smart sensors and actuators to enhancemanufacturing and industrial processes. Also known as the industrial internet or Industry 4.0, IIoT 
 uses the power of smart machines and real-time analytics to take advantage of the data that "dumb machines"have produced in industrial settings for years. The driving philosophy behind IIoT is that smart machines 
 are not only better than humans at capturing and analyzing data in real time, but they're also better atcommunicating important information that can be used to drive business decisions faster and more accurately.
